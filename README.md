# Notepad Application on Android

Notes app created with React Native

## About
This calculator app was created with React, and follows closely to a [tutorial guide](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmL8ueRKDy8), with the source code [provided here](https://github.com/NikValdez/FirstReactNativeAppTut). What differentiates from the tutorial guide is that I added options for the user to select, should they wish to have them, such as adding bold or italicized font.

To view and run this application, you will need Expo Go on your simulated Android device, and you will also need a few libraries, such as [ui-kitten](https://akveo.github.io/react-native-ui-kitten/). More of where you need the libraries can be found in the tutorial guide video.
